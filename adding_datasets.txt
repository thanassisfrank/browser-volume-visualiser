These are instructions on how to setup a new dataset so that it can be used in the program

0. For .vts files, the vtk module is needed thus "pip install vtk" should be run first

1. Navigate to static/data/datasets.json
2. Create a new, blank object with a unique key.
3. Add a name value (string) to the entry

    1. Add the .raw file into the data/ folder
    2. Add the entry "type": "raw"
    3. Add the entry "path": "data/[file name]"
    4. Add the entry "size": {"x": [z size], "y": [y size], "z": [x size]}
    5. Add the entry "dataType" with a value of one of
       "float32", "int16", "uint8"
4b. If the dataset is .vts files
    1. create a new folder within the data/ folder
    2. Add the dataset .vts files into this new folder
    2. Add the entry "type": "structuredGrid"
    3. Add the entry "path": "data/[new folder name]/"
    4. Add the entry "originalFiles" with a list of the original .vts file names as the value
5. To generate the required files for a complex dataset run:
   python processDataFile.py [dataset key]
